Hi, I’m Dhanunjaya 👋  

I’m a QA Automation Engineer (SDET-1) with experience in manual and automation testing, currently working in a startup SaaS environment.

I started my journey as a Manual Tester, where I built a strong foundation in understanding product behavior, user flows, and risk-based testing. Over time, I transitioned into QA Automation and now work on automating web and API test scenarios using Python, contributing to automation frameworks, and supporting CI/CD pipelines.

🔧 What I focus on:
- QA Automation (Web & API)
- Python-based test automation
- API testing and validation
- Improving test reliability and coverage
- Continuous learning and problem-solving

📌 I use this GitHub to document learning projects, automation experiments, and testing concepts that help me grow as an SDET.

Always open to learning, collaboration, and knowledge sharing.
